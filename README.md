# Cameron's Web-UI

## Project: Local Park Passport

## Local Park Passport is the definitive guide for find this best parks in your area depending on what your tastes are.

## MVP
- As a user I can create and login to an account
- As a user I can add parks to the app.  Required: name, location, description.  Optional booleans: dog park, wildlife, hiking trails, disc golf, open spaces, climbing trees, etc.
- As a guest (not logged in) I can search for parks that meet the criteria I am looking for
- As a user I can rate parks I have visited and leave comments about it

## STRETCH
- As a user I can upload pictures of the park
- As a user I can share my experience at a park on social media 

## **My primary role as a User Interface Developer:**

- [ ]  Build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by your group and provides the user with details about the product your team has selected to build.

    Without a UI designer, we had to choose our own font styles, colors, and design. They are as followed :

    Font: 'Roboto', sans-serif and 'Playfair Display', serif.
    Colors: #445c3c #c9d99e #fda77f #fae8c8
    Design: loosely based off of AllTrails website --> https://www.alltrails.com/


- [ ]  Your marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths.

    Website was designed using a desktop first approach with media queries at 800px and 500px.

- [ ]  The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that your Front End Architect is building.

    For this, a responsive hero button was designed with our logo.

- [ ]  Your marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform like "Netlify" or "Github Pages".

    You can find the website here --> 

- [ ]  For this Marketing site's home page you need to have content and copy that relates to the product that your team is workinfg on.

    Included a concise overview, our mission statement and pictures with descriptive captions.

- [ ]  For a second page, you could do an about us section that includes images of the members of your team, and links to one another's socials/Github.

    Our second page is an about us page with descriptons of our roles and links to our GitHub

## Struggles to consider

- Without a UI designer, it is challenging to make a uniform design across all roles.

- With only less than a week to work, communication with the react and backend teams is a challenge as they have a lot to work on together that does not involve Web-UI.
